My name is Matt, this is one of my blogs.
    Site under construction, obviously...
      ... The purpose of this blog has yet to be determined in full,
      but I have a starting place.

For the time being it will be the place that I publish my work on Watson API projects - data mining topics, issues, trends, events and individuals of cultural significance.

I hope this blog serves as a unique perspective on topics of interest, and also chronicles my works in attempting to improve qualitative analysis in A.I. and machine learning.

I in no way claim to be THE master of culture, but I am an M.S. in Applied Anthropology, and the name was available, so I found it apropos and a slight stroke to the ego.  

I am sure the commit rate will increase as I go, but at the moment it is slow going... much to do.

Subscribe if you want to get some neat data analysis that merges applied inductive ethnographic and UX research methodologies with Natural Language Processing machine learning and metadata mining and other cutting edge A.I. and as a bonus, early subscribers will get to see a Rails neophyte (me) turn into a ninja!
